# SSL-check
Script to check if SSL is used and what algorithm is used
 There is a file called "sites_to_check_ssl". In this file you put the domainnames of the site you want to check. You can run the script from a Linux computer/server and the script wil create a output file. In this output file you will find all the sites checked and if they are running HTTPS you will get information about the algorithm and when the certificate ends.
